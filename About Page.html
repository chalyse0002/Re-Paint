	  <h4>About</h4>
		   <p>  Newcastle is known for being an innovative and flourishing creative hub of Australia. Home to many world class art facilities, schools and galleries, such as Hunter street Tafe Art and Design, The Lock Up and the Newcastle Art Gallery. The city finds itself on the map as a destination for exposure to the arts. However, many do not realise that the arts, similarly to other forms of production, comes at an environmental cost that tends to be overlooked. 
      </p>
    
    <p> Picture yourself passionately painting a beautiful canvas, what you are left with is two things, a wonderful piece of art and a cup of murky paint water and messy brushes. Many agree that the issue of paint waste is one without an effective, easy to access solution, and unfortunately, in the end, many of us are guilty of simply washing paint down the drain.

    <p> Art institutions usually set the bench-mark for environmentally friendly practices. 
      But Fact: Paint is a toxin and polluting substance, which when disposed of incorrectly, can be extremely harmful to the environment. Unless this issue is addressed, paint will continue to harm our systems by clogging our waterways, polluting our oceans and harming marine life. 
      </p>
    <p>Considering the damage paints can inflict on our environment, our solution aims to prevent creative paint from being disposed of in drains by providing artists and institutions with a device which functions to solve this problem by separating the paint from the water. 
      </p>
    <p> ‘RePaint’ is an easy to install device and attachable to existing sinks and cleaning areas of studios and creative spaces. Artists and students will use RePaint to wash contaminated utensils and paint water, the device then collects the solid matter while returning clean water to the drain. The collected by-product (paint pigment and matter) can be recycled and used again in the studio in many fun and creative ways!
